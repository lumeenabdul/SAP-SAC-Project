# SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) – Sales Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates how I’ve used **SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)** to analyze and visualize sales data across multiple regions and product categories.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using sample sales data, I created an interactive dashboard that shows:
- Net Sales Revenue across products and regions
- Gross Margin % over time
- Regional and product-level performance
- Year-wise comparison and insights

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Data modeling and enrichment in SAC
- Story and dashboard building
- Generating business insights from raw data
- Hands-on experience with KPIs, filters, and chart features

## 🌎 Business Scenario
Imagine a retail business operating in states like **California, Nevada, and Oregon**. This dashboard helps identify which products are performing well, where gross margin is falling, and how sales are evolving year by year — enabling better decision-making.

## 🌟 Summary of Insights

*Pepsi had strong sales in early years, and its gross margin increased significantly in California.

*Orange with pulp showed gross margin decline — needs further investigation.

*Coconut Water grew in sales by 2015 but suffered a gross margin drop.

*Gross margin per date has been consistently declining — may indicate rising costs or pricing issues.

*California is a strong performing state across categories.
